WARNING: If the LAST previously played rando version was 0.1.0 or lower, you will need to first update Nova to 1.0.1 and do the following!!!
-Make sure Nova is on 1.0.1. Download links for Nova are on the rando github download page.
-Uninstall any mods if any have been installed on Nova 1.0.1.
-Delete Unpacked Game Data for LR (from the first tab of Nova).
-Unpack the data again.

(Ereshkigal shuffling corrupted unpacked data on old versions causing Bhuni to loop. So if you continue getting issues with Bhuni and have NOT done the above this could be the cause)

If you need to view these instructions again, click the Changelog button in the bottom right of rando.
